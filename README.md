# Code Quiz

* This interactive application allows the user to take a 6 question code related quiz. Upon pressing start, the user has 60 seconds to complete the quiz but the caveat is that if the user selects the incorrect answer, 5 seconds will be deducted from their time for each wrong answer. For each correct answer, the user will receive 3 points and the total will be displayed at the end of the quiz.
